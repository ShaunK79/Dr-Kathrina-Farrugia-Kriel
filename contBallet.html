    <p class="books-p-external">Edited by Dr Kathrina Farrugia-Kriel and Dr Jill Nunes Jensen, The Oxford Handbook of 
        Contemporary Ballet prioritizes connections between ballet communities as it interweaves 
        chapters by scholars, critics, choreographers, and working professional dancers.<br><br> 
        The book looks at the many ways ballet functions as a global practice in the 21st century, 
        providing new perspectives on ballet's past, present, and future. As an effort to 
        dismantle the linearity of academic canons, the fifty-three chapters within provide 
        multiple entry points for readers to engage in balletic discourse.<br><br> With an emphasis on 
        composition and process alongside dances created, and the assertion that contemporary 
        ballet is a definitive era, the book carves out space for critical inquiry. Many of the 
        chapters consider whether or not ballet can reconcile its past and actually become present, 
        while others see ballet as flexible and willing to be remolded at the hands of those with 
        tools to do so.</p>
