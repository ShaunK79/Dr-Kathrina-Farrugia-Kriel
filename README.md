# Dr-Kathrina-Farrugia-Kriel

  I am very proud of this project. Alot of sweat, blood and tears has gone into this
  but I have enjoyed every moment. I found it challenging and rewarding but I have learnt 
  so much from this. Thanks to my wife who gave me this challenge and for having the patience,
  it's finally here!!
  
  Biggest lessons learnt was the javascript - fixed navbar and hamburger icon, scroll to top button
  and of course CSS and HTML - grid layout, div positioning, responsive( media queries), structuring of a website.
  
  I know there is still much to learn but Im excited for the journey ahead. This has given me the confidence to 
  continue building efficient and affective webpages.
