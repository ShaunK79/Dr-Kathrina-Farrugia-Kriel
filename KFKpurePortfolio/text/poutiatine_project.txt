The life and work of Russian émigré princess Nathalie Poutiatine (1904 – 1984) are central to the development of ballet in Malta (1930 – 1979).
Retracing intangible histories: Marking the centenary anniversary of Poutiatine’s first arrival in Malta in 2019, there has been much interest in retracing the hidden archives of the repertoire and pedagogy that became synonymous with the Art of Ballet in Malta. Until I began the Poutiatine Project in 2014, both Poutiatine’s pedagogy and repertoire were distant or forgotten memories, almost ‘lost’ as a result of time. Two recordings  of the Poutiatine’s repertoire and teaching over the course of the decades survive. Nevertheless, various artefacts survive in her former students’ bureaus, cabinets and boxes of memorabilia: photographs, programmes, clippings from newspapers and Poutatine’s own writings on ballet. In the Poutiatine Project (2014-2019), oral history offered another dimension to the research; former dancers, family members and friends were interviewed on the lasting legacy of this pioneer of the stage and studio.

Through bringing together the research on Poutatine’s legacy, including extracts of the reconstruction of her pedagogy (music and class), articles, conference papers, and of course the book,  these pages aim to be a repository site for various updates on Princess Poutiatine and the Art of Ballet in Malta. Resources on this site include a playlist of the music choices in Poutiatine’s repertoire and the reconstruction of a ballet class from 1953, including selections of the twelve barre (side practice) exercises and the twelve centre practice (Adage, and Allegro). I hope that these pages summarize the Poutiatine Project, as well as offer different insight into the scholarly work that sustains the legacy of ballet pedagogy and repertoire in the life and times of Princess Nathalie Poutiatine.
