Listen to a sample of the music compositions used in Poutiatine’s pedagogy and repertoire.
Music choices for class:  Below is a sample of music accompaniment for class, reconstructed in 2017 from  Poutiatine’s handwritten musical scores (1953/1964) and performed by Maltese pianist Erika Gialanze. The extracts from the scores and recordings of the music reconstructions indicate an approximate tempo for the performance of the exercises. They reflect Poutiatine’s choices for her class choreography, drawing upon her knowledge of the influences in pedagogy at the Imperial Ballet School through her studies with Lubov Egorova in Paris (1921-1926). 

The three examples below can be listened to in conjunction with the article ‘In Pursuit of ‘Intangible’ Histories: Nathalie Poutiatine’s Art of Teaching Ballet‘ published in Treasures of Malta (December 2023).
