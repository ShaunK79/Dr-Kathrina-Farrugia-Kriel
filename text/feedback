Professor Emerita Lynn Garafola (author of Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, 1998): “Thanks to Kathrina Farrugia-Kriel’s Princess Poutiatine and the Art of Ballet in Malta, we meet one of the emigration’s lesser-known figures, a woman who transformed the art she could not practice into a quietly heroic calling.”

Professor Janice Ross (author of Like a bomb going off: Leonid Yacobsen, 2015) : “Kathrina Farrugia-Kriel’s major achievement in Princess Poutiatine and the Art of Ballet in Malta, is her capacity to bring attention to these underpinnings essential to the bursts of individual voice and cultural identity in ballet. She has excavated a lost history and, in the process, has produced a timely reminder of the life of privilege of many who studied ballet in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in Russia, reminding us how it endured as a part of their identities in exile as well.”
