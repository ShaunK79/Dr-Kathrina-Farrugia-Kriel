Following her studies at the Nesta Brooking School (London), Tanya introduced the Cecchetti Method in classical ballet in Malta and established her school in 1965. Working extensively as a dancer and choreographer in films and musicals, including Fiddler on the Roof and No No Nanette, her choreographic work was showcased in both local and international festivals by her company, and within theatre and television productions. In 1981 Bayona amalgamated with Princess Poutiatine Academy of Ballet which became known as the ‘Tanya Bayona-Poutiatine Academy of Ballet’, which she directed until 2004. Several of her students now run some of the leading ballet schools on the island.
